      <h3>Something I Learned</h3>
      I have obviously learned many things in ECS. Most important I think, besides the actual coding, is the idea that most problems can actually be solved by just thinking about it and developing a strategy,
      not just troubleshooting or worrying.<br>
      <h3>Advice to future ECS Students</h3>
      Always look at tought problems a second time. Like Mr. Heo says, the answer most times is right in front of you, or maybe even in the instructions.
